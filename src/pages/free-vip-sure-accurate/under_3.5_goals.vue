        <p class="leading-loose my-3">
            Betting on football can be both exciting and lucrative. However, it requires a lot of analysis, research, and
            expertise. This is where Omoyetips comes in. We are a team of betting experts who specialize in providing our
            users with free under 3.5 goals betting tips. In this article, we will take a closer look at how under 3.5 goals
            works, and how you can maximize your profits by following our tips.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-lg my-3 font-bold">Under 3.5 Goals Betting Tips Explained</h2>
        <p class="leading-loose my-3">
            In football, the most common goal-line bet is over/under. This is a bet on whether the number of goals scored in
            a match will be over or under a certain number. Under 3.5 goals betting is a popular option among punters, as it
            offers higher odds and greater returns than traditional win-draw-win bets.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-loose my-3">
            Under 3.5 goals betting works by betting on a football match to have less than four goals. This means that if
            there are three or fewer goals scored in the match, your bet will be a winner. If there are four or more goals
            scored, your bet will be a loser. Under 3.5 goals betting is a popular choice for punters who are looking for a
            more conservative approach to their betting strategy.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-lg my-3 font-bold">Calculative Example</h2>
        <p class="leading-loose my-3">
            Let's take a look at an example to help explain how under 3.5 goals betting works. We will use a match between
            Manchester United and Liverpool as an example.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-loose my-3">
            Manchester United vs Liverpool
        </p>
        <p class="leading-loose my-3">
            Over/Under: 3.5 Goals
        </p>
        <p class="leading-loose my-3">
            Under 3.5 Goals - 1.75
        </p>
        <p class="leading-loose my-3">
            Over 3.5 Goals - 2.15
        </p>
        <p class="leading-loose my-3">
            If you bet on under 3.5 goals in this match, you are betting that there will be three or fewer goals scored. If
            you bet N100 on under 3.5 goals at odds of 1.75, you will win N75 if there are three or fewer goals scored in
            the match. If there are four or more goals scored, your bet will be a loser, and you will lose your N100 stake.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-loose my-3">
            On the other hand, if you bet on over 3.5 goals in this match, you are betting that there will be four or more
            goals scored. If you bet N100 on over 3.5 goals at odds of 2.15, you will win N115 if there are four or more
            goals scored in the match. If there are three or fewer goals scored, your bet will be a loser, and you will lose
            your N100 stake.
