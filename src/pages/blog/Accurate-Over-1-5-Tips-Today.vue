        <p class="leading-loose my-3">
            Before we proceed further, it's important to grasp the concept of over 1.5 goals in the context of sports
            betting. Over 1.5 goals refers to a betting market where the bettor predicts that there will be two or more
            goals scored in a particular football match. If the match ends with two or more goals, the bet is considered a
            winning bet. This popular betting market offers a higher chance of success compared to traditional 1X2 (Home
            Draw Away) markets, as it allows for multiple goal outcomes.

        <h2 class="text-lg my-3 font-bold">How Do Odds Work in Over 1.5 Betting?</h2>
        <p class="leading-loose my-3">
            When it comes to over 1.5 betting, understanding how odds work is essential for making informed decisions. Odds
            represent the probability of a specific outcome occurring in a match. They also determine the potential payout
            you can receive if your bet is successful.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-loose my-3">
            In over 1.5 betting, the goal is to predict whether the total number of goals scored in a game will be two or
            more. Let's look at an example to understand how odds work in over 1.5 betting.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-lg my-3 font-bold">Examples of How Over 1.5 Goals Odds Work</h3>
        <p class="leading-loose my-3">
            In a game between Arsenal and Manchester City, the odds for over 1.5 goals are set at 1.75. If you decide to
            place a N100 bet on over 1.5 goals at these odds, there are two possible outcomes:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-decimal ml-7">
            <li class="leading-loose my-3">
                <span class="font-bold">Winning Bet: </span>If the match ends with two or more goals, your bet is
                successful. In this case, you would receive a payout based on the odds. To calculate your winnings, you
                multiply your stake by the odds.
                <br />
                <span class="font-medium">Winnings = Stake x Odds</span>
                <br />
                <span class="font-medium">Winnings = N100 x 1.75</span>
                <br />
                <span class="font-medium">Winnings = N175</span>
                <br />
                Therefore, if your bet on over 1.5 goals is correct, you would receive a payout of N175, including your
                initial stake.
            </li>
            <li class="leading-loose my-3">
                <span class="font-bold">Losing Bet: </span>If the match ends with only one goal or no goals, your bet is unsuccessful, and you would lose your stake of N100.
                <br />
                Iimportant to note that odds can vary across different bookmakers and are influenced by factors such as team form, player injuries, and other statistical indicators. As a bettor, analyzing the odds and comparing them among different bookmakers can help you find the most favorable value and potential returns for your over 1.5 goals bets.
